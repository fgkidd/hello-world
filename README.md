# hello-world
Just learning Github. Watch me grow!

Hmm. I got my Master's in Aerospace Engineering and my PhD in Mechanical Engineering. 
It was only during my PhD that I really got into coding in python.
I never really felt like I had time in the rush of research to sit down and become a proper programmer.
This is a start.

Hopefully a few years from now my Github will be filled with my projects in machine learning/data science/web scraping etc.
Ive got big plans. Maybe this will hold me to them.

Welp. On to other things for now. Best of luck to all who read this in their programming adventures.
